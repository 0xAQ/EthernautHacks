## What is Ethernaut
Ethernaut is a Web3/Solidity based wargame inspired by overthewire, to be played in the Ethereum Virtual Machine. Each level is a smart contract that needs to be 'hacked'. The game acts both as a tool for those interested in learning ethereum, and as a way to catalogue historical hacks as levels.
